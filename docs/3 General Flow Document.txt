User Administration is completely managed by 'Admin' user

Relation among Vendor, Tender and Quotation:

1. A Tender Manager creates a Tender and assigns the same to a set of selected vendors.

2. A Vendor when login to the system, sees all the Tenders assigned to him/her

3. The Vendor selects a Tender and creates a Quotation. The vendor can also upload a document along with the Quotation.

4. Similarly all the Vendors who are assigned to a Tender creates their Quotations against a Tender

5. The Tender Manager can view all the Quotations created by various vendors against a Tender, review the contents of each Quotation against a Tender carefully and Approve one of them and Reject others.

6. When the Tender Manager Rejects a Quotation, only the status of the selected Quotation would be changed to 'Rejected'

7. When the Tender Manager Accepts a Quotation, the status of the selected Quotation would be changed to 'Accepted' and the status of rest of the Quotations would be changed to 'Rejected'

8. The Tender Manager closes the Tender
